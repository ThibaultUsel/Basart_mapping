RDF mapping of exhibition data using #CIDOC-CRM

Documentation is available in the "documentation" repository.
A python script is available in the "annexes" repository, that transform the X3ML files generated using 3M. It changes the "rdfs:label" relations in "crm:P190_has_symbolic_content" when needed.
